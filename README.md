### Hey folks! 👋

My name is João Antunes (but I’ll respond to Johnny or John, as it’s much easier for non-portuguese speakers). I work as a software engineer, mostly with .NET technologies, but I like to play around with other tech as well. My main interests are software architecture, design and development, with more focus on the backend but with a view of the whole stack.

I’m also a supporter of remote work, as I believe our industry is in a privileged position to provide the best work-life balance, skipping unneeded commutes and relocations.

Some extra tidbits:
